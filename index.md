# Startup in Finland guidelines from the TE Office. 

Welcome to Finland. It's a nice country with friendly people and amazing nature. The following post tries to cover the aspects of applying for a startup grant from TE Services. 
Please use this guide at your own risk. I have translated the original text from TE Services, and intend it to be a guideline to give an overall picture. 

## Application 
### Apply for Startup Grant application ( 12/11/2020 - mm/dd/yyyy)
The start-up grant secures the entrepreneur's livelihood for the estimated time it takes to start and stabilize the business - up to a maximum of 18 months. The start-up allowance is equal to the basic daily allowance and is paid for a maximum of five days per calendar week.

When planning a business and applying for a start-up grant, first contact the Yritys-Suomi telephone service, whose Business Advisors will advise and guide you in setting up a business and applying for a start-up grant. 

Also contact the TE Office when you are planning to start a business. As a general rule, start-up grant will not be granted if a full-time business has started before a decision has been made to grant a start-up grant.  

To make an appointment, leave a contact request in the Personal Customer's online transaction channel (Services for a Start-up Entrepreneur) or by calling the TE Office's employer and corporate customer telephone service. Be prepared to discuss the planned business and business idea with the TE Office's expert, the competitive situation in the field in the area, as well as your readiness to become an entrepreneur and the need for support at the beginning of the business. 

### Application and follow-up application
Start-up money is applied for in two periods. First of all, find out the start-up funding process in your area on the TE Services website before submitting the application.

The TE Office advises on the documents required in connection with the start-up grant application, which include a business plan and profitability and financing calculations. In addition, a certificate of payment of taxes is required ( www.vero.fi/verovelkatodistus ). Also attach a balance sheet to your documents if you have previous entrepreneurial experience. You can make a business plan with profitability and financing calculations in the Enterprise Finland online service ( oma.yrityssuomi.fi ), where Business Advisers will guide you in making them if necessary.

Please fill in the application form carefully and make sure that all the necessary attachments are included before submitting your application. This speeds up the processing of the matter in the TE Office.

If a person who has become an entrepreneur with a start-up grant submits an extension application for a start-up grant, the TE Office will assess, among other things:

- The need for expert service outside the TE administration
- whether the business has started as planned during the previous period, for example in relation to the presented business plan
- whether the income from the business adequately secures the entrepreneur's livelihood

Among other things, the need for a follow-up application will be assessed on the basis of these factors. The application for an extension of the start-up grant is submitted no later than one month before the end of the start-up grant period, so that any expert service outside the TE administration can be obtained and the extension decision is made without interrupting the payment of support.
